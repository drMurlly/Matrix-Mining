### Docker Image   
   
This is where we build the Docker image. It's got everything you need to make a Docker Image.   
   
You can also grab the Docker image from Docker Hub right here:   
https://hub.docker.com/r/drmurlly/matrix   
   
To get the image on your computer, just use this command:   
docker pull drmurlly/matrix   
   
If you wanna run the matrix miners, you need to set up two wallets, A and B, for each mining node, just like the official guide says:    
https://docs.matrix.io/guides/create-mining-masternodes-in-ubuntu-linux-with-matrix-ai-network    
   
Don't worry about syncing the blockchain from scratch. I'll hook you up with the latest snapshot of the fully synced blockchain, so you can skip the long wait of syncing from the start or even from the latest snapshot.
