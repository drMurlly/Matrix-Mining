### WHAT IS MATRIX AI NETWORK? 
https://www.matrix.io/

Matrix AI Network ($MAN) is a decentralized AI (Artificial Intelligence) platform combining blockchain technology with AI capabilities. It aims to create an ecosystem where AI and machine learning algorithms can be developed, deployed and incentivized securely and transparently. Matrix AI Network utilizes its own AI-driven blockchain to support various applications and services, including data analysis, intelligent contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps). The network also emphasizes privacy and security by implementing advanced encryption techniques. Matrix AI Network aims to revolutionize the AI industry by providing a decentralized and efficient platform for AI development and deployment.


### Matrix AI Network consensus mechanism
Matrix AI Network uses a unique PoS + PoW hybrid consensus mechanism. In this mechanism, the Proof of Work (PoW) process is carried out in a smaller network of delegates. These delegates are selected using a random distributed voting algorithm, and the probability of a node being selected is proportional to its Proof of Stake (PoS). The selected delegate, the "winner" delegate, shares the PoW reward with other nodes in its cluster. This approach helps eliminate latency issues commonly arising when scaling blockchain networks. By combining the advantages of both PoS and PoW, MATRIX AI Network aims to achieve a more efficient and secure consensus mechanism. PoS helps to ensure that nodes with a higher stake in the network have a greater chance of being selected, while PoW helps maintain the blockchain's security and integrity. Overall, the hybrid PoS + PoW consensus mechanism employed by MATRIX AI Network enables the network to achieve high performance and scalability while maintaining a secure and decentralized system.

### Mining (PoW)
The miners in Matrix AI Network are elected through a process called random clustering algorithms (RCA). These algorithms categorize nodes based on their characteristics and then select representatives from these categories through true random elections. This ensures fairness in the election process. Only the elected miners participate in PoW mining, while other miners do not participate in every mining cycle. This allows Matrix to export the extra computing power on its platform to clients who need it, similar to a cloud computing platform.

Blacklisted Miners are miners who have been penalized for not correctly executing their mining transactions. If a miner is blacklisted, they face a suspension from mining activities for one cycle. The blacklisted miner's list is cleared after every Round Robin cycle.


### Estimated average return for MINING approx. 36% (APR)
The mining reward is very dependent on what kind of hardware is used. APR is calculated from data for the last 6 months based on 60 consistently working miners. The used mining CPU is AMD Ryzen 9 7950x and AMD Ryzen 9 5950x. A similar reward can be achieved with Intel Core I9-13900KS. The APR can decrease significantly if the miners are not managed reliably and not-so-strong hardware is used.
Annual Percentage Rate (APR) refers to the annual interest generated by a sum paid to miners, expressed as a percentage representing the actual yearly income earned on an investment. It's worth noting that APR considers that miners are created with 10.000 MAN and does not consider compounding.

### How to use this container
Operating mining masternodes for the Matrix AI Network within Docker containers enables streamlined management of multiple miners on a single machine. As these miners are unlikely to be selected simultaneously, deploying multiple containers enhances the likelihood of fully leveraging your hardware's capabilities. Our testing has shown that running one miner per CPU thread is feasible. Consequently, on a machine equipped with 32 CPU threads, it is possible to operate up to 34 mining masternodes concurrently. The best performance in this case is achieved with 30 MN running.
